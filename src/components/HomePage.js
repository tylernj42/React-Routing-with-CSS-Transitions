                        <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
                        <p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>
                        <p>Ask her how her day was. Oh God, what have I done? Daylight and everything. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? It must be wonderful. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</p>
                        <p>Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</p>

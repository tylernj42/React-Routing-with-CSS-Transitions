                            You don't know how to do any of those. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. I love you, buddy! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Now what? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
                        </p>
